I'm Travis â€” builder, technologist, musician, and systems designer.

I work at the intersection of AI, automation, engineering, and creative independence.  
My mission is simple: Build modular, scalable tools that empower individuals to operate at higher levels.

I'm currently developing open-source software, AI agent frameworks, customer management systems, and creative projects that blend technology and human craftsmanship.

I believe in ownership over employment, systems over grind, energy over time.

Building in public. Always learning.
