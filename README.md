# Codex Memory Toolkit (Early Build)

**Project Status:** Early MVP  
**Author:** Travis E. Barker

---

## 🎯 Mission

Codex Memory Toolkit is a modular, human-centric memory scaffolding system designed to persist operational knowledge for AI and operators alike.

Originally built for Codex CLI, but easily extensible to any agentic or LLM-driven assistant system.

---

## 🛠️ Features (Planned)

- Structured memory folder architecture
- Dynamic manifest loading (context layering)
- Local-first, no-cloud dependency (unless extended)
- Minimal dependencies (bash, jq)
- Expandable to any Codex, GPT, or local LLM setup
- Future features: Tagging, archiving, branching memory contexts

---

## 📜 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codex-memory-toolkit.git
cd codex-memory-toolkit
bash load_codex_memory.sh
```

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Persistence is power.  
AI is useful, but modular memory is transformational.

This toolkit is designed for builders, operators, and those who seek to operate independently of centralized systems.

## 📈 Roadmap

- [x] Version 0.1 — Manual loading script (COMPLETE)
- [ ] Version 0.2 — Memory context tagging
- [ ] Version 0.3 — Memory context diff and merge tool
- [ ] Version 1.0 — GUI Memory Manager (Optional Extension)

*Built by a systems builder, for systems builders.*
