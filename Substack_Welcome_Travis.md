# Welcome to the Build Lab

I'm Travis.  
I'm on a mission to create tools, systems, and platforms that multiply human creativity, autonomy, and power.

This isn't a marketing feed.  
This is a real-time build log — automation, AI, music, engineering, software, life design.

You'll find:
- New projects
- Experiments and failures
- Lessons learned
- Tools and templates I actually use
- Thoughts on building systems that matter

I'm not teaching from a stage.  
I'm working from the field.

If you're building something real — or want to — you're in the right place.

Let's work.
