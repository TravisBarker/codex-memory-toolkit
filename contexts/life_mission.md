# Life Mission
I am Travis.  
My mission is to build persistent creative, financial, and intellectual independence through AI, automation, music, engineering, and entrepreneurship.

I prioritize energy over time, assets over tasks, and systems over willpower.

This is the root context for all AI interactions unless otherwise specified.
